and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Map variable IntelliSense** - Intelligent key completions when accessing AutoIt Map variables
  - Shows available keys when typing a Map variable name (e.g., typing `$map` shows known keys)
  - Tracks Map keys across your workspace and included files
  - Works with both direct assignments (`$map["key"] = value`) and declarations with initial keys
  - Configuration options to tune behavior:
    - `autoit.maps.enableIntelligence` - Enable/disable Map intelligence (default: true)
    - `autoit.maps.includeDepth` - Maximum depth for resolving #include files (default: 3, range: 0-10)
    - `autoit.maps.showFunctionKeys` - Show Map keys assigned in functions (default: true)
  - See [docs/map-support.md](docs/map-support.md) for performance tuning recommendations

### Changed

- Enhanced README documentation with Map intelligence feature details

## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-10

### Added

- COM object syntax highlighting for properties and methods using dot notation
- Distinct token scopes for COM identifiers (`support.class.com.autoit`) to enable theme-specific styling
- Contributors section to README.md with auto-updating contrib.rocks integration
- Added missing AutoIt macros: `@exitMethod`, `@GUI_DropId`, and `@SW_ENABLE` to completions and hovers
- AU3Check parameter parsing support with corresponding tests to improve syntax check behavior
- Parameter validation and improved status messages in OutputChannelManager (#230)
- WinNet API completions added to IntelliSense

### Fixed

- Function pattern incorrectly matching COM object methods (e.g., `$obj.Method()` now correctly identified as COM, not function)
- Incorrect documentation for `@GUI_CtrlId` macro (now correctly states "Last click GUI Control identifier" instead of "Drag GUI Control identifier")
- Duplicate WinNet signature removed and WinAPI COM signatures added to signature/hover data
- Incorrect CRLF constant definition corrected
- Duplicate parameter documentation entries removed in signature help provider
- Removed stray duplicate (misspelled) `Clibpoard` completion entry
- Improved parameter checks in `runCheckProcess` for more reliable regex matching

### Changed

- Consolidated macro data into single source of truth (`src/completions/macrosData.js`) to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency between completions and hovers
- Converted `src/hovers/macros.json` to `src/hovers/macros.js` to import from unified macro data source

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added

- File path validation to prevent path traversal attacks
- Parameter safety warnings for `autoit.consoleParams` to detect potentially dangerous shell metacharacters
- Workspace symbol performance optimizations with batch processing to prevent UI freezing on large projects
- Configuration options `autoit.workspaceSymbolMaxFiles` (default: 500) and `autoit.workspaceSymbolBatchSize` (default: 10)
- Configuration option `autoit.symbolMaxLines` (default: 50000) to control maximum lines processed for symbol information
- Warning message when files exceed symbol processing limit with actionable instructions
- Comprehensive unit tests for completion provider with 8 test cases
- Comprehensive README documentation improvements with installation guide, quick start section, platform support matrix, troubleshooting guide, and reorganized configuration
- Distribution scripts for packaging the extension to multiple marketplaces:
  - `package-all.js` for simultaneous packaging to VS Code Marketplace and OpenVSX
  - `package-openvsx.js` for OpenVSX-specific packaging with publisher name handling

### Fixed

- Command injection risk in registry update functionality by replacing `exec` with `execFile` for safer argument handling
- Multiple global output panels opening for AutoIt on startup
- Memory leak in completion provider where include cache grew indefinitely across document switches
- Incorrect array comparison logic in completion cache invalidation
- Cross-document contamination of completion items from include files

### Changed

- Simplified ESLint configuration by using globals package and removing redundant rules
- Workspace symbol cache now uses incremental updates instead of full invalidation on file changes
- Completion provider now uses per-document Map-based caching with LRU eviction (50 document limit)
- Include cache automatically cleans up when documents are closed
